After doing Univariate , Bivariate and Multivariate analysis on the given STUDENT_DATASET (provided by DS community)  
I have reached on the following conclusions :

INSIGHTS
 
After analysing the data and charts I came to conclusions:

DEMOGRAPHICS : 

1> Most of the students in sample space belonged to age of 26 ( 5.2% ) then followed by 29.

ACADEMICS :

1> The relation between IQ and Age was vey much balanced so no trend or pattern was established.

TRENDS , PATTERNS AND SUMMARY

Finally seeing all the data and graphs I have concluded it is a balanced data .
Everything was well distributed and arrangent in a manner where finding particular trends was quite hard .  
But I have done my best to demonstrate the graphs and my findings and relationships of Marks , IQ , Gender and Age .
